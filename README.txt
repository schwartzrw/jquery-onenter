RWSApps OnEnter jQuery Plugin

Automatically creates a Javascript handle for all onenter events the same way browsers natively support onclick, onblur, etc.

OnEnter automatically:

* Detects all OnEnter attributes on any given element
* Supports elements that are loaded dynamically through Javascript or AJAX
* Supports the passing of all valid Javascript/AJAX calls through the OnEnter attribute
